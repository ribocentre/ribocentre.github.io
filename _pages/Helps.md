# Help Page


Ribocentre is designed to contain comprehensive information of all Ribozyme that have been isolated by in vitro selection and in vitro evolution. In addition to different Ribozyme pages, you will find links to the original publications which consist of timeline of the development. The reaction conditions, reaction substrates, metal-ion requirements, and structural information are showed whenever available.
