# Ribocentre Website

This is the website of our ribozymes database.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

Ribocentre is designed to contain comprehensive information of all natural ribozymes. Ribozymes are good systems for understanding the ‘sequence - structure - function’ relationship of RNA molecules, since ribozymes are found in the genomes of species from all kingdoms of life and play a role in important reactions such as peptide-bond formation, RNA splicing, transfer RNA biosynthesis, and viral replication. This is therefore an excellent time to summarise these properties, and our new web-based database will make this generally accessible.<br>

An example of the use of Ribocentre. Take the twister ribozyme as an example. More details please click <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac840/6731740" target="_blank">here </a>.<br>
In addition to a brief introduction to ribozymes, on each ribozyme page, you’ll see a timeline of vital breakthroughs in ribozyme research, representative structures and the chemical mechanism of this ribozyme. Besides, we provide multiple indexing and searching methods, you can index/search about the publications, structures, catalyses and applications of ribozymes that interest you. Users are welcomed to submit new ribozyme cases or related comments through the submission portal to help us improve our database.<br>

The Ribozymes page at Ribocentre. (A) A list of 21 ribozyme families are shown on the page. (B) Clicking on the ribozyme name brings up the information page for the chosen ribozyme. (C–F) The timeline, description, structure and mechanism, and references for the hammerhead ribozyme.<br>More details please click <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac840/6731740" target="_blank">here</a> or our database <a href="https://www.ribocentre.org" target="_blank"><strong>Ribocentre </strong></a>.
